# Message Board App
The message board app (when hosting local server) allows user to navigate to localhost:3000/new and input a message along with a name. After hitting submit, it returns the user to the index and shows the message on screen.

## Need to do
* Add styling
* Link to pages via buttons (keeps user from manually typing in url)

## What this project does:
* Input user's message on message board.
* Saves user's input so long as server is running

## What this project doesn't do (yet?):
* Save entered information across server restarts
* Share entered information with other users.
