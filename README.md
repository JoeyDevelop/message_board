# Message Board App

The [Message Board](https://message-boardd.herokuapp.com/) app allows users to input a message along with a name. After hitting submit, it returns the user to the index and shows the message on screen, along with the date and time it was submitted (EST)

## Need to do

- Upgrade styling
- Add authentication (?)

## What this project does:

- Input user's message on message board.
- Saves user's input to database (Will stay even after server reset)
- Allow user's to see other users messages

## What this project doesn't do (yet?):

- Have authentication
- Show timezone in relation to user (ONLY SHOWS EST)
- Have good style ;P
